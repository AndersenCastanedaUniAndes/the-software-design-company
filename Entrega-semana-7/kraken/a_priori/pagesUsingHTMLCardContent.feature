    Given I navigate to page "<BASEURL>"
    And I wait for 5 seconds
    And I enter email "<USERNAME>"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I enter password "<PASSWORD>"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I click sign in button with selector "button[type='submit']"
    And I wait for 7 seconds
    And I go to the pages section
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I click in the new page button
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I enter title "$name_title" into field with selector "textarea.gh-editor-title"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I click in the add a card button
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I click in the card option "<CARD_OPTION>"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I enter the HTML content "<HTML_CONTENT>" in the card
    And I wait for 3 seconds
    When I click outside the card
