  @user1 @web
  Scenario Outline: Como usuario administrador quiero agregar un nuevo tag a√±adiendo meta data con datos a priori para validar el ingreso de datos
    Given I navigate to page "<BASEURL>"
    And I wait for 5 seconds
    And I enter email "<USERNAME>"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I enter password "<PASSWORD>"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I click sign in button with selector "button[type='submit']"
    And I wait for 4 seconds
    And I try to remove the new version banner
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    When I go to the tags section with selector "a[data-test-nav='tags']"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I click new tag button with selector "a.ember-view.gh-btn.gh-btn-primary"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I enter tag name "<TAG_NAME>" into field with selector "input[id='tag-name']"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I expand section with selector "body > div.gh-app > div > main > section > form > section > div:nth-child(1) > div.gh-expandable-header > button"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I enter data "<META_TITLE>" into field with selector "#meta-title"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I enter data "<META_DESCRIPTION>" into field with selector "#meta-description"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I enter data "<META_URL>" into field with selector "#canonical-url"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I click in the save button
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    And I go back to the tags section clicking the tags button with selector "a[data-test-nav='tags']"
    And I wait for 1 seconds
    Then I must see the success created "<TAG_NAME>" in the tag list or the confirmation to leave page if tag was not created
